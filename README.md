#App architecture

1) The framework used is Android Studios.
2) The most important parts of the system are the MainActivity.java and activity_mail.xml files which I have coded to make the resulting app.
3) To modify the apps main functionalities, the MainActivity.java and activity_mail.xml must be modified

Using Umple I have created a state diagram which describes how the game works. The Umple files for this can be found here in this repository (at PFath046/Simple_TicTacToe)
